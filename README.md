## Slack Bot Bookstore

### Motivation

Reading is valuable, but books can be expensive. Sharing books (especially those in niche topics) allows those within any budget to read more books.

### Tech/Framework

Bolt - Slack Bot messaging
Express - incoming POST requests from Slack
NodeJS
MongoDB (Mongoose)

### Status

This project is in the first stages of development. There is currently an MVP with Slack slash commands `/showlibary` and `/donatebook` that also have interactive buttons.

The development goal is to gather more information via a book API, validate information, provide a checkout and transfer action that utilizes Slack modal windows and dynamic options.
